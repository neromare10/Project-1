## A review of the explanatory variables of GDP. A case for Colombia

The following document reviews (through the CRISP DS methodology) the predictive capacity of other macroeconomic variables in explaining Colombia's GDP. For this specific case we are going to answer the following questions.

###1) Are inflation, the level of unemployment, the Gini index, the only explanatory variables of Colombia's GNP?
###2) Can we incorporate non-traditional explanatory variables such levels of immunization of the population, monetary poverty index, difficulty of a woman in getting a job in the explanation of GDP?
###3) After incorporating these variables to our analysis. Can an acceptable R2 be evidenced with these variables?
